<p>You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered desktop, tablet, and mobile. The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. Tablet view should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.
</p>

<div class="section col-lg-4 col-md-6">
<div id="title">Title 2</div>
<p>Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/”lorem ipsum”, it doesn’t matter.6ow the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23.)

<p>The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop, tablet, and mobile. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page, NOT 3 pages. In other words, you will be creating a single, responsive page.
